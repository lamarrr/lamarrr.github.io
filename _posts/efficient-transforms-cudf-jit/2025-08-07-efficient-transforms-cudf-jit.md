I authored this article for NVIDIA's Developer Blog, exploring how Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation enables efficient data transformations in cuDF. The work demonstrates how JIT compilation can significantly improve performance for GPU-accelerated dataframe operations by generating optimized code at runtime, eliminating the overhead of traditional interpreter-based approaches.
